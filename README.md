# gthealthsystem
System to detect people who were close to a person with coronavirus covid-19.
System created to help authorities to track places where people went. This will register the timestamp, the userid and the place id.

For system operation is necessary to use 3 aplications:

1. First application called appcentro is a native Android app that scan QR code and save the register.
2. Second application called appusuarios is a webapp. In this webapp the user (people) will create their account and get a QR code. This QR code will be neccesary to enter to the places.
3. Third application called webappmonitoreo is a webbapp where the authorities can find the user historial and block them.

*This works with Firebase.
